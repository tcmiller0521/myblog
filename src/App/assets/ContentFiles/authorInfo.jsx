    {author: "Taylor Miller",
    bio: "Taylor is Wyoming born and raised! She loves being snowboarding, painting, graphic-design, camping, and being outdoors in general. She is a huge animal lover and dreams of one day having her own ranch with horses, cows, chickens, and of course plenty of dogs! She bought Oakley from a small local ethical breeder who prides themselves on breeding healthy and good-natured dogs! It was always her dream to have a dog that could go everywhere with her, Oakley became that dog! Because of this, Taylor wanted Oakley to be well-behaved and polite. She began researching positive reinforcement training methods and started Oakley's training using these methods. Now, she is a huge advocate for positive reinforcement training and wants to help other understand it and learn how to implement it into their training.",
    brief: "As Oakley's mom, Taylor takes pride in making sure Oakley is taken care of and properly trained. She is a huge advocate from positive reinforcement training and using it to create a well-behaved fur baby!",

    {author: "Oakley Miller",
    bio: "Oakley is a two year old mini aussiedoodle and her parents think she is the cutest and goodest girl out there! No bias, of course! She lives with her parents and parakeet sister, Petri. Oakley looks forward to her monring and evening walks every day and loves to lounge around in between walks. She also enjoys barking at strangers who walk down 'her' street as well as squirrels that reside in a large pine tree in her yard. If she's not barking at something, you can probably find her chasing rabbits, cuddling with her parents, or intently staring at her bird sister who she believe should come out of her cage and 'play' with her. She also spends her time training her humans to buy her the best treats and toys on the market and to walk her whenever she wants! Oakley hopes to help other dogs learn how to train their humans too.",
    brief: "Oakley is her parent's pride and joy! She loves going on walks, playing with her bear and monkey, chasing rabbits and going on hikes! She is cute and she knows it! Even so, she is the goodest girl ever!",

    author: "Matthew Miller",
    bio: "Matthew was born in Montana but moved to Wyoming when he was 15 years old. He loves snowboarding, hiking, fishing, and flying! As a kid his dream was always to become a pilot, and he has achieved that at the age of 17 when he got his private pilot license. His next goal is to get his commercial license and fly for an international airline! In the meantime, he spends his time playing flight simulator and getting bossed around by Oakley and Taylor. (They have him wrapped around their paw and finger) He loves curling up on the couch with his girls, watching a movie and eating popcorn. If he's not at home, you can probably find him on the slopes or trying to catch a fish while trying to keep Oakley from leaping head first into the freezing lake! Matthew is dedicated to his family and their safety and hopes to help other with staying safe.",
    brief: "Matthew likes to think he is Oakley's favorite parent, but Taylor would beg to differ. He and Oakley love to wrestle and play, but their favorite pass time is watching old shows and eating popcorn together!",
